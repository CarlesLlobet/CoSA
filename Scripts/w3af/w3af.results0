[37mThe following error was detected and could not be resolved:
The remote web server is not answering our HTTP requests, multiple errors have been found while trying to GET a response from the server.

In most cases this means that the configured target is incorrect, the port is closed, there is a firewall blocking our packets or there is no HTTP daemon listening on that port.

Please verify your target configuration and try again. The tested targets were:
